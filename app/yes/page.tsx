          Thanks for saying yes even though you didn't have any other choice. 
          I love you so much and I hope you know that even if you sometimes think we got too comfortable.
          I can't believe we've been together for 5.5 years and I loved every bit of it.
          I love how you make me laugh, how you support me, and how you always know how to cheer me up.
          I love your smile and your laugh and your stomach and your eyes and your legs and everything about you.
          I can't waittt so see you again and spend a bunch of time with you cuz I miss you.
          Anyways thanks for being my valentine. Byeee
